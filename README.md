***RESOURCES*** 

Software: Splinter, Beautiful soup, Flask, Beautiful Soup, MongoDB, Google, Python, Jupyter Notebook/conda, VSC.

Data Sources: Mars News, Mars Featured Images, Mars Facts, Mars Hemispheres.



***OVERVIEW***

The purpose of this challenge was to utilize the above software to access, scrape and 'beautify' Mars websites in order to assist Robin in creating a web app and store it in the MongoDB. Additionally, html code was added to create a title, adjust the app to accomodate the required sizing for various devices, and display the Mars Hemispheres images with either interactive or thumbnail adjustments, as displayed below.



***RESULTS AND SUMMARY***

In order to accomplish the above, a mission2mars.ipynb was created and altered to the Mission_to Mars_Challenge.py and .ipynb to perform the aforementioned stipulations. Additionally, an app.py file was created to bridge the index.html file in the templates folder and the scraping.py code was created to scrape the webpage for the desired facts, tables, images and images. Bootstrap components were added to the html.index file in orfer to add a subheader, accomodate the page to adjust to the desired/chosen device and add interaction/thumbnails to the hemisphere images, as seen below (Mission_to_Mars final and copy).
